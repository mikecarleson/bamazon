This assignment shows how a mySQL database can be connected to a CLI app. In this fictional market place of Bamazon, you will be prompted to purchase items. If the quantity of items is sufficient, you will have made a purchase and the inventory in the database will be updated. If there are not enough items in stock to supply your order, you will be prompted to purchase less of the item or a different item. To start the app type in "node bamazonCustomer.js" to the terminal and start shopping!
